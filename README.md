<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Vinly G. Tolentino</h1>

<h3>I am a Computer Science student. I chose this course not because I love coding, but because I love computers. I once tried participating in a PC assembling and disassembling contest but backed out because I didnâ€™t find it enjoyable. I realized that I am more interested in computer aesthetics rather than hardware itself. Also, while I don't consider myself particularly talented, I can manage a little bit of everything. I can dance but wouldnâ€™t attempt to sing. I can draw, though only with references (like youtube or pinterest).</h3>

<h3> I don't have any personal projects, but I've worked on projects from my CMSC courses, such as a game called "Grow and Conquer," where players collect fragments to increase their attack points and defeat monsters and other players, and a mobile slambook app named "Ribbit". I am familiar with programming languages like Python, C, and Dart which I learned from my previous CMSC courses. </h3>

<h3>In my free time, I enjoy scrolling through social media for inspiration on building, cleaning, and designing PCs. Although I donâ€™t know how to build a PC myself, I love cleaning them and adding accessories to my workstation. Having a clean, dream setup motivates me to complete my assignments, code projects, and perform other computer-related tasks. Aside from PC setups, I enjoy playing video games, focusing mainly on Valorant and NBA 2K. I also love rewatching Disney movies because as a kid, I didnâ€™t fully understand them, but now they often bring me to tears.</h3>
